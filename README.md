# letsfindmybooks

This is an Ionic React application called "letsfindmybooks" One React-based codebase that runs on the web, iOS, and Android using Ionic Framework UI components. letsfindmybooks is fully responsible for any device and uses google books API to display books. The first page includes an input field you can search for any book name and it will display the books as cards and buttons on cards that go to book links that you can purchase, view e-books, or display additional information on which modal component used for that. On the second page, you can search books based on book category with the same functionality as the first page. The third page includes the PWA element camera which Capacitor Camera, Filesystem, and Preferences APIs are used for that. You can take pictures of your favorite books and save them in your book gallery(3rd page). Search results are saved in localStorage and when the page reloads it will display the previous search results.
